Hello fellas!

This is Grand-Delta, but you can also call me Damien. I'm just a young guy, newbie in the world of programming and computers. Even though I'm a rookie at this, I can say that I always feel passionated when it comes to computers and technology. I feel that the most important thing here is to feel the motivation. This, will bring the rest to me, referring to the knowledge and the skills.
